        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The goal of this machine learning project is to address the challenges of fault detection and diagnosis in industrial systems. With the increasing complexity of industrial systems and the abundance of IoT-generated data, traditional analytical models struggle to provide effective solutions.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Scope</h2>
        <p>The project focuses on detecting abnormal functioning in industrial processes, which may arise from equipment failures, control system malfunctions, changes in resource availability, or non-conformity issues. Once abnormal functioning is detected, the system aims to locate and identify the root cause to facilitate decision-making for corrective actions or system reconfiguration.</p>
        
        <h2>Methodologies</h2>
        <p>Various machine learning techniques will be applied to tackle fault detection and diagnosis problems. These techniques include Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN), Decision Trees (DT), and Bayesian Network (BN).</p>
        
        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
        <p>If you're interested in contributing to this project or collaborating with us, please feel free to reach out via [provide contact information or a link to your contact page]. We welcome partnerships and contributions from the community to advance the field of fault detection and diagnosis in industrial systems.</p>
